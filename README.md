# Keylogger Program

## Introduction

Welcome to the Keylogger Program! This Python program is designed to record and log keystrokes, saving them to a file. It's important to note that creating and using keyloggers without proper authorization is illegal and unethical. This demonstration is intended for educational purposes, and you should only use it on systems where you have explicit permission.

## Features

- **Keystroke Logging:** Records and logs every key pressed by the user.
  
- **File Saving:** Saves the recorded keystrokes to a file for later analysis.

## How to Use the Keylogger

**Disclaimer:** Ensure that you have proper authorization before using this tool.

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yumnamugheez/PRODIGY_CS_04.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   Change your working directory to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd TASK 4
   ```

3. **Run the Keylogger:**
   Execute the Python script to run the Keylogger:
   ```bash
   python TASK 4.py
   ```

4. **Record Keystrokes:**
   The program will silently run in the background, recording and logging every key pressed.

5. **Stop the Keylogger:**
   To stop the keylogger, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

6. **View the Log:**
   Open the generated log file (default: `keylog.txt`) to view the recorded keystrokes.

## Example

Here's a snippet from the generated log file:

```plaintext
2022-03-01 12:00:01 - Key pressed: H
2022-03-01 12:00:02 - Key pressed: e
2022-03-01 12:00:03 - Key pressed: l
2022-03-01 12:00:04 - Key pressed: l
2022-03-01 12:00:05 - Key pressed: o
2022-03-01 12:00:06 - Key pressed: Space
2022-03-01 12:00:07 - Key pressed: W
2022-03-01 12:00:08 - Key pressed: o
2022-03-01 12:00:09 - Key pressed: r
2022-03-01 12:00:10 - Key pressed: l
2022-03-01 12:00:11 - Key pressed: d
2022-03-01 12:00:12 - Key pressed: Enter
```
